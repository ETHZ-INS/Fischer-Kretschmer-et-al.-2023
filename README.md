# Sperm chromatin accessibility's involvement in the intergenerational effects of stress hormone receptor activation 2023
Code, objects and rendered rmarkdowns for ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data for Fischer, Kretschmer et al. 2023. Code is deposited in GEO (GSE233892  and GSE234039)
Empty folder structure are equivalent to structure in scripts.
Tdg_wt and Dex_Veh should include processed sequencing data.
Object_resources contains objects generated during analysis and objects which the scripts depended on.
Objects for archetypes (motifs), 5fC sites in sperm DNA and fasta file for GRCm38 are missing and need to be downloaded separatly. 
Archetypes are from:
Vierstra2020 Vierstra, J., Lazar, J., Sandstrom, R. et al. Global reference mapping of human transcription factor footprints. Nature 583, 729â€“736 (2020)
5fC sites in sperm are from:
